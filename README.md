# Final-Project---Expense-Tracker
This file is building an expense tracker mini-functional app as the final project in the class of Data Structure and Algorithm at Parami University in the Spring semester of 2025. 

**Project Description **
We used a Linked List to add and calculate the total expenses of the day.
We used Stack to track back the previous expenses of the previous day. 
There are 5 more functions that can add new expenses, view daily expenses, view monthly expenses, delete an expense, and exit the function.

Thank you so much for visiting our project, and would appreciate a friendly suggestions to us for better improvement.
